# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release of datannur is actively supported with security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it privately:

- **Email**: [contact@datannur.com]
- **Response time**: We aim to respond within 72 hours
- **Process**: We will acknowledge receipt, investigate, and coordinate disclosure

Please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

## Security Considerations

datannur is designed with security in mind:

- **Client-side only**: No server components reduce attack surface
- **Local data**: Data remains on user's system unless explicitly deployed
- **Browser isolation**: Runs within browser security sandbox

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices:

1. Report received and acknowledged
2. Investigation and fix development
3. Coordinated public disclosure
4. Security advisory publication (if applicable)

Thank you for helping keep datannur secure.
